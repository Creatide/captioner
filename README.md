# Captioner Script

I created this simple script to streamline the captioning process when training new LoRa models. It identifies elements in an image using OpenAI's vision model, so **you will need to use your OpenAI API key to utilize it.**

The script also has the capability to scale images according to the longer side, after which the image is converted into a base64 format. Scaling allows you to reduce the image size and consequently the number of tokens used.

The script also includes a simple exponential backoff retry function, ensuring that the requests to the server are not made too frequently and overwhelming it.

## Examples of captions generated by the script:
